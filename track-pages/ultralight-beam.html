	[Kanye West &amp; The-Dream:]<br>
	I'm tryna keep my faith<br>
	We on an ultralight beam<br>
	We on an ultralight beam<br>
	This is a God dream<br>
	This is a God dream<br>
	This is everything<br>
	This is everything<br>
	Deliver us serenity<br>
	Deliver us peace<br>
	Deliver us loving<br>
	We know we need it<br>
	You know we need it<br>
	You know we need it<br>
	That's why we need you now, oh, I<br>
	Pray for Paris<br>
	Pray for the parents<br>
	This is a God dream<br>
	This is a God dream<br>
	This is a God dream<br>
	We on an ultralight beam<br>
	We on an ultralight beam<br>
	This is a God dream<br>
	This is a God dream<br>
	This is everything<br>
	Everything (Thing, thing, thing)<br>

<p class="lyrics">
	[The-Dream &amp; Choir:]<br>
	I'm tryna keep my faith<br>
	But I'm looking for more<br>
	Somewhere I can feel safe<br>
	And end my holy war<br>
	I'm tryna keep my faith<br>

<p class="lyrics">
	[Kelly Price (Choir):]<br>
	So why send depression not blessings?<br>
	Why, oh why'd you do me wrong? (More)<br>
	You persecute the weak<br>
	Because it makes you feel so strong<br>
	(To save) Don't have much strength to fight<br>
	So I look to the light<br>
	(Lord) To make these wrongs turn right<br>
	Head up high, I look to the light<br>
	Hey, cause I know that you'll make everything alright<br>
	And I know that you'll take good care of your child<br>
	Oh, no longer am afraid of the night<br>
	Cause I, I look to the light<br>
</p>
<p class="lyrics">
	[Chance The Rapper:]<br>
	When they come for you, I will shield your name<br>
	I will field their questions, I will feel your pain<br>
	No one can judge<br>
	They don't know, they don't<br>
	They don't know, they don't know<br>
	Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea<br>
	I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia<br>
	Treat the demons just like Pam<br>
	I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina<br>
	I been this way since Arthur was anteater<br>
	Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap the bam<br>
	Tryna snap photos of familia<br>
	My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her<br>
	You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille<br>
	Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail<br>
	I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell<br>
	I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail<br>
	He said let's do a good ass job with Chance three<br>
	I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy<br>
	Let's make it so free and the bars so hard<br>
	That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet<br>
	This is my part, nobody else speak<br>
	This is my part, nobody else speak<br>
	This little light of mine<br>
	Glory be to God, yeah<br>
	I'mma make sure that they go where they can't go<br>
	If they don't wanna ride I'mma still give them raincoats<br>
	Know what God said when he made the first rainbow<br>
	Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro<br>
	Ugh, I'm just having fun with it<br>
	You know that a nigga was lost<br>
	I laugh in my head<br>
	Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt<br>
	Ugh, cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike<br>
	You cannot mess with the light<br>
	Look at lil Chano from 79th<br>

<p class="lyrics">
	[Kirk Franklin &amp; Choir:]<br>
	Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough.<br>
	This prayer's for everybody that feels like they're too messed up.<br>
	For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times.<br>
	You can never go too far when you can't come back home again. That's why I need...<br>
	Faith, more, safe, war
